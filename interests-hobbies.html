          <li>Dancing: For me dancing is not just a hobby, it's about feeling the music, expressing myself and having fun.</li>
          <li>Tennis: I thrive on competition and rush of the game. Tennis is my favorite sports, it challenges me in different ways and keeps me engaged, focused and always striving to improve.</li>
          <li>Traveling: If i could, I'd spend my days traveling the world. To me traveling is about experiencing life from different perspectives and embracing the beauty of the world.</li>
          <li>Reading novels: Novels are my escape imto different worlds, every page brings new adventures, characters and perspective that make life more interesting. I just love how novels have the power to make me think deeply, cry and laugh.</li>
          <li>Drawing: Sketching allows me to channel my creativity and transform my thoughts into visuals.</li>
